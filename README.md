# Netflix---Data-Exploration-and-Visualization

Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 222M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. 

Our aim while exploring this dataset is to analyze the data and generate insights that could help in deciding which type of shows or movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.

We are interested in increasing the revenue of Netflix, hence our main objective is to figure out which all shows and movies performed the best.
